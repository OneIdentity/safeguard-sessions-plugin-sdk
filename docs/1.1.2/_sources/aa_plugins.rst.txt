AA plugin development
=====================

The AA plugin skeleton enables rapid AA plugin development by providing a base class that implements common plugin
functionality that any plugin should possess. There are also helper functions and Python decorators for simplifying
frequent tasks.

The functionality that is implemented supports the requirements set out in the technical document
*Creating custom Authentication and Authorization plugins*, which can be found on the One Identity web site.
