Getting started
===============

To begin developing with the Plugin SDK the following components are required:

* working `Pipenv <https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ tool,
* working Python 3.6+ interpreter,
* a downloaded copy of the Plugin SDK development package.

To download the Plugin SDK, visit the `Download software <https://support.oneidentity.com/download-product-select/>`_
page on the One Identity home page. Note that to download software you need to have a registered support account.

Starting from scratch
---------------------

Create a Pipfile that contains at least these lines:

.. code-block:: ini

    [packages]

    [dev-packages]
    pytest = "*"
    pytest-cov = "*"

    [requires]
    python_version = "3.6"

Build a python virtual environment which will be used to develop and test the plugin:

.. code-block:: bash

    pipenv install

To (re)install the Plugin SDK replace ``<path-to-plugin-sdk-tar-gz>`` with the actual location of the downloaded Plugin
SDK package and run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pipenv run pip install -U <path-to-plugin-sdk-tar-gz>

Create the necessary ``MANIFEST`` file for the plugin and add a source file, for example ``main.py``.

The code in main.py is now usable together with the Plugin SDK inside the virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    pipenv shell
    python main.py
