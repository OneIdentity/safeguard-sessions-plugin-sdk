pluginv build script
====================

The ``pluginv`` build script is available in the development environment after the environment is set up according to
:ref:`gettingstarted-label` section. This section lists the main options and tasks provided by the pluginv script.

Every command is to be executed in the virtual environment created by pipenv, that is after ``pipenv shell`` is invoked
to activate the virtual environment.


Version of Plugin SDK
---------------------

To get the Plugin SDK version on the command line, execute the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pluginv -V

Snapshot build
--------------

To build a snapshot version of the plugin, use the command

.. code-block:: bash

    pluginv dist

which checks the consistency of administrative data for the plugin, add the current time to the version in MANIFEST and
create the plugin ZIP package. See the next section for details about the ZIP build.

Release build
-------------

To build a release version of the plugin, use the command

.. code-block:: bash

    pluginv release

which checks the consistency of administrative data for the plugin and create the plugin ZIP package. The ZIP package
creation involves invoking several tools from the pipenv tool chain such as ``pipenv``, ``virtualenv`` and ``pip``.
During the build a new virtual environment is created in the ``build`` directory while the final ZIP package is
placed in ``dist`` directory. The name of the distributable ZIP package is the name of the plugin plus the version
number followed by the zip extension.

Run test scenarios
------------------

If you want to test your plugin, use the ``run-scenario`` subcommand to run a basic RDP with gateway
authentication scenario.
The ``config-file`` parameter is the name of a pre-written config file the plugin will use. You can also
provide the gateway and target username with the ``gateway-username`` and ``target-username`` parameters
respectively.

.. code-block:: bash

    pluginv run-scenario --config-file=config.ini --gateway-username=gateway --target-username=target
