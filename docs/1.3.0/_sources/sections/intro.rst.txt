Introduction
============

The One Identity Safeguard for Privileged Sessions Plugin Software Development Kit (Plugin SDK) provides base classes
and services to enable rapid development of Python 3 plugins for the Safeguard for Privileged Sessions product.
The Plugin SDK helps implement the requirements stated in the documents

* Creating custom Authentication and Authorization plugins developer's guide,
* Creating custom Credential Store plugins developer's guide.

The documents above are part of the `One Identity technical documentation \
<https://support.oneidentity.com/one-identity-safeguard-for-privileged-sessions/technical-documents>`_.

The :class:`AAPlugin <safeguard.sessions.plugin.aa_plugin.AAPlugin>` base class can be used as starting point to create
an Authentication and Authorization plugin. The :class:`MFAClient <safeguard.sessions.plugin.mfa_client.MFAClient>` base
class can be used together with :class:`AAPlugin <safeguard.sessions.plugin.aa_plugin.AAPlugin>` for simple integration
with multi factor authentication services where the user identity and password is enough for a successful
authentication.

The services described in section :ref:`services-label` implement various generic functions as well as functions
specific to Safeguard for Privileged Sessions. Even the Safeguard for Privileged Sessions specific functions can be
invoked in any Python development environment. To populate the Safeguard for Privileged Sessions specific functions with
test data outside the product, use the "fake" services listed in section :ref:`fake-services-label`.
