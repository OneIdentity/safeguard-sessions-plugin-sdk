Getting started
===============

To begin developing with the Plugin SDK the following components are required:

* working `Pipenv <https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ tool,
* working Python 3.6 interpreter,
* a downloaded copy of the Plugin SDK development package.

To download the Plugin SDK, visit the `Download software <https://support.oneidentity.com/download-product-select/>`_
page on the One Identity home page. Note that to download software you need to have a registered support account.

Starting from a plugin skeleton
-------------------------------

There is a basic AA plugin skeleton on GitHub.com:
`https://github.com/OneIdentity/safeguard-sessions-plugin-skeleton-aa \
<https://github.com/OneIdentity/safeguard-sessions-plugin-skeleton-aa>`_ that can be used as a starting point for the
next steps.

Starting from scratch
---------------------

If you prefer to start from scratch, create a Pipfile that contains at least these lines:

.. code-block:: ini

    [packages]

    [dev-packages]

    [requires]
    python_version = "3.6"

Preparing the python environment
--------------------------------

Build a python virtual environment which will be used to develop and test the plugin:

.. code-block:: bash

    pipenv install -d

To (re)install the Plugin SDK replace ``<path-to-plugin-sdk-tar-gz>`` with the actual location of the downloaded Plugin
SDK package and run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pipenv run pip install -U <path-to-plugin-sdk-tar-gz>

Note that by installing the Plugin SDK it will install its dependencies as well, including selected Python packages
with the same version as found on a the SPS appliance.

This step need not be repeated unless a new Plugin SDK is installed or the dependencies of the plugin change.

Using the python environment
----------------------------

Create the necessary ``MANIFEST`` file for the plugin and add a source file, for example ``main.py``.

The code in main.py is now usable together with the Plugin SDK inside the virtual environment. To build a snapshot
plugin ZIP package, execute the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    pipenv run pluginv dist

The resulting file will be in the ``dist`` directory, ready for upload to a Safeguard for Privileged Sessions appliance.
