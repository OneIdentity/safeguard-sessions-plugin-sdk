AA plugin development
=====================

The :class:`AAPlugin <safeguard.sessions.plugin.aa_plugin.AAPlugin>` base class enables rapid authentication and
authorization plugin development by providing a base class that implements common AA plugin
functionality that any AA plugin should possess. There are also helper functions and Python decorators for simplifying
frequent tasks. The :class:`MFAClient <safeguard.sessions.plugin.mfa_client.MFAClient>` base
class can be used together with :class:`AAPlugin <safeguard.sessions.plugin.aa_plugin.AAPlugin>` for simple integration
with multi factor authentication services where the user identity and password is enough for a successful
authentication.
