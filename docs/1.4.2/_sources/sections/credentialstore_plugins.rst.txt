Credential Store plugin development
===================================

The :class:`CredentialStorePlugin <safeguard.sessions.plugin.credentialstore_plugin.CredentialStorePlugin>` base class
enables rapid credential store plugin development by providing a base class that implements common credential store
plugin functionality that any such plugin should possess. There are also helper functions and Python decorators for
simplifying frequent tasks.

*New in version 1.2.0.*
